I made a few bucks on a freelance project recently. On these platforms, you rarely get your money as soon as you complete the gig. So, awaiting my payoff, I was wondering what am I going to buy. As I said, it wasn't a lot, so I couldn't afford something very ‚Äúuseful‚Äù. And, it hit me. I'm going to work that hard, and spent all the money I made, and work that hard again‚Ä¶ You see where I'm going. As I was thinking about investing, I told myself, why not building a SaaS. SaaS stands for Software as a Service, it's a kind of subscription you pay to use a software, it's opposed to lifetime licenses, where, when you pay, the software is yours for life.

_With freelancing, I'll always have to put in a lot of work to earn the relatively same amount of money. Otherwise, with a SaaS, I'll put a lot of effort upfront and relax later._

First question, what am I going to build? I thought about an old Flutter app I coded a long time ago. It's a quote management app called **Meditations**[^1]. I really wanted to add a bunch of exciting features like `!@#$%^&`, but never got time (and motivation) to do so. Now, money will be the motivation üòÖ. A project? Got it. What's next?

Simply put, the first feature I'm going to ship is quote syncing. To do so, I need a backend and a database to store the user's quotes. Am I going to code a backend? No! I'm going to use PocketBase[^2]. PocketBase is an open source backend. It lets you create a data model in a UI and generate API endpoints for you. It uses SQLite to persist data (I know, when you think of a database, SQLite isn't the first option you might think of, but I don't except my app get a billion concurrent requests anytime soon).

| Pros                                          | Cons                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| API, auth and a nice dashboard out of the box | Still under active development |
| Lightweight                                   | Doesn't scale horizontally     |

_Pros and cons of using PocketBase._

After not having to code a backend, I decided to add an API management solution called Kong[^3]. I wanted the following features: **rate limiting and caching**. It was mandatory for me. If my app is going into the wild, I want it to be prepared for that. I designed the following architecture:

_Desired backend architecture._

The backend will be connected to Kong and the latter will be **reverse-proxied** by Caddy (precisely caddy-gen[^4], a great Docker image that automate caddy for Docker containers). Then, I started playing with the Kong Docker image. First disappointment: it needs Postgres or Cassandra (a column-oriented database) to run. Quickly got over it after digging into the docs and discovered the db-less mode. After spending many hours tweaking my `docker-compose.yml`, I found successively that the Kong Manager (their GUI admin dashboard) and rate limiting plugin wasn't available for the open sourced version. Just at this time, I wondered why I'm not using Traefik[^5] (Traefik is reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS like Caddy). Back in the day, I struggled to configure Traefik, this is why I switched to Caddy and was using it everywhere. But, I got Traefik to work not so long ago, therefor I checked it out, and it had all the Kong features I wanted, plus a very nice dashboard üòâ.

Finally, I got this architecture[^6]:

_Actual backend architecture._

Once my setup was working on `localhost`, I had to make it available through the Internet. I spun up my infrastructure with Terraform[^7] and Ansible[^8] on GCP[^9]. Spent like two days on this, writing IaC[^10]. Now that I have my backend up and running, it's time to dust off the mobile app. See you in the next one üòâ
