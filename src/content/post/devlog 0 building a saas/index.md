I made a few bucks on a freelance project recently. On these platform, you rarely get your money as soon as you complete the gig. So, awaiting my payoff, I was wondering what am I going to buy. As, I said, it wasn't a lot, so I cannot afford something very ‚Äúuseful‚Äù. And, it hit me. I'm going to work that hard, and spent all the money I made, and work that hard again‚Ä¶ You see where I'm going. As I was thinking about investing, I told myself, why not building a SaaS. SaaS stands for Software as a Service, it's a kind of subscription you pay to use a software, it's opposed to lifetime licenses, where, when you pay, the software is yours for life.

_With freelancing, I'll always have to put a lot amount of work to earn the relatively same amount of money. Otherwise, with a SaaS, I'll put a lot of effort in front but can relax later._

First question, what am I going to build? I thought about an old Flutter app I coded a long time ago. It's a quote management app called **Meditations**¬π. I really wanted to add a bunch of exciting features like `!@#$%^&`, but never got time (and motivation) to do so. Now, money will be the motivation üòÖ. A project? Got it. What's next?

Simply put, the first feature I'm going to ship is the quote syncing. To do so, I need a backend and a database to store the user's quotes. Am I going to code a backend? No! I'm going to use PocketBase¬≤. PocketBase is an open source backend, it let you create a data model in a UI and generate API endpoints for you. It uses SQLite to persist data (I know, when you think of a database, SQLite isn't the first option you might think of, but I don't except my app get a billion concurrent requests anytime soon).

| Pros                                          | Cons                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| API, auth and a nice dashboard out of the box | Still under active development |
| Lightweight                                   | Doesn't scale horizontally     |

_Pros and cons of using PocketBase._

After not having to code a backend, I decided to add an API management solution called Kong\[¬≥\]. I wanted the following features: **rate limiting and caching**. It was mandatory for me. If my app is going into the wild, I want it to be prepared for that. I designed the following architecture:

_Desired backend architecture._

The backend will be connected to Kong and the latter will be ‚Äúreverse proxied‚Äù by Caddy (precisely caddy-gen‚Å¥, a great Docker image that automate caddy for Docker containers). Then, I started playing with the Kong Docker image. First disappointment, it needs Postgres or Cassandra (a column-oriented database) to run. Quickly got over it after digging into the docs and discovered the db-less mode. After spending many hours tweaking my `docker-compose.yml`, I found successively that the Kong Manager (their GUI admin dashboard) and rate limiting plugin wasn't available for the open sourced version. Just at this time, I wondered why I'm not using Traefik‚Åµ (Traefik is reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS like Caddy). Back in the days, I struggled to configure Traefik, this is why I switched over Caddy and was using it everywhere. But, I got Traefik to work not so long ago, therefor I checked it out, and it had all the Kong features I wanted, plus a very nice dashboard üòâ.

Finally, I got this architecture‚Å∂:

_Actual backend architecture._

Once my setup was working on `localhost`, I had to make it available through the Internet. I spin up my infrastructure with Terraform‚Å∑ and Ansible‚Å∏ on GCP‚Åπ. Spend like two days on this, writing IaC¬π‚Å∞. Now that I have my backend up and running, it's time to dusted off the mobile app. See you on the next one üòâ

_At least I haven't failed üòÖ_
