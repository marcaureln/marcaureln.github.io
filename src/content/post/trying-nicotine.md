i bought a pack of nicotine gum. 2 mg nicotine per gum. i never smoked before. but i wanted to cut down my caffeine intake. i discovered long ago[^1], that (1) it have the same effects as caffeine without messing with sleep (2) nicotine is not the thing that actually causes lung cancer in cigarettes and (3) there is nicotine in other forms (gum, patch, pouches, spray, etc.). so since then, i always wanted to try out. i was running some errands and stumbled across a pack on the drugstore corner. and here we are, me, myself, and a pack of 30 gums.

i told people around me about my new thing, and everybody was like, “wtf”, “it’s bad”, but what struck me the most was “you’ll be addicted to this”. and this made me think. i’m aware of the addictive power of nicotine. i withdrew from caffeine, alcohol, and other shit i can’t list here. my p.o.v. on this is that, i’m willing to take that risk to serve a greater purpose that is achieving my goals. we all have addictions: sugar, phones, socials, etc. the sad truth is that we didn’t “pick” those. and most of them are either net negative or at best give us nothing in return.

i’ll experiment with this and maybe write about it in another post. for those interested, i plan on doing 2 gums per day, 3-4 days a week during a month. in the end, pick your addiction, and if you can have none, lucky you.

**ps**: nicotine is highly addictive (surely the highest addictive substance i ever took); there is more health related issue with nicotine than caffeine, in no way you should blindly considere replacing caffeine with nicotine.
